=Wish List=
Horrible, crippling, ridiculous bugs:
* When you POST an article with an existing name which has no revision for the supplied version, it naively assumes the article doesn't exist, and so it creates a new one.
** Solution: time to just sunset articleId? It's kind of a waste of time. Versioned article renaming seems like a small price to pay.
** Status: FIXED, not thoroughly tested.

Bugs:
* When you go forward/backward (or maybe navigate in menu) while in draft mode, the draft disappears
** DONE, not thoroughly tested
* When you set to any version other than the latest stable, you can't edit anything! This is probably because the "create/update draft" SQL isn't bothering with version number, or drafts aren't version-specific for some reason.
** DONE, not thoroughly tested
* Literally cannot update the menu on the s7 site (possibly others/all). It makes a new article every time.
** Fixed?
* When your session expires, the UI fails to detect it and prompt accordingly. Also, the API should return 401, not "no user found".
* When you send the wrong username/password to login, there is no error messsage.

WikiUtil:
* Render inside each TD/TH as if it were on its own line, so things like indent work as expected.
* Flair: tokens in wikitext that add classes to #articleView.

Images:
* Refresh images on upload, not on hard refresh

Article Edit:
* Show active drafts for other users.
* Resize view/edit divider as you see fit; toggle becomes "auto update" only.
* If you edit an article with a draft for version X, but a published revision of version Y, where Y.rank>X.rank...wtf do you do?

Social:
* Provide RSS feeds and/or emails.
* Comments!

Visual:
* Version icon.
* Tooltips for gears.
* TOC: more intuitive way to open, and/or keyboard shortcut.

General:
* Restore "linkedArticles" feature
* Favorites!
